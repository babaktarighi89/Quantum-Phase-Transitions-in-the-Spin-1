# Quantum-Phase-Transitions-in-the-Spin-1
This is a repository for the paper Quantum Phase Transitions in the Spin 1 Bilinear-Biquadratic Heisenberg Model Based on Classical and Quantum Correlations.
The "data" folder contains all the data for the figures, with each text file named according to its corresponding figure. The "all_data" folder includes all the extracted data used for measurements and calculations in the paper, but only the most important and largest possible sizes are shown in the figures.
